# TMake
An android application, which is used to customize a t-shirt. Customization involves the process selecting the type of a t-shirt. After selecting, the t-shirt is dynamically generated using the screen height and width, hence making it device independent. The t-shirt can be colored with the help of a color picker. The user can now add any text he wishes to and also insert any picture of his choice which is present in his phone gallery or which he clicks instantly. Various shapes are provided which helps the user create patterns and hence incorporate this pattern in the entire t-shirt.
